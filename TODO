List of various todos before jumpi is considered stable:

- restructure API
  * remove unneeded serialization/de-serialization of json within go-API
- handle keys with care
  * secret keys are somewhat lingering in memory, since they are cast
    to string to []byte and back, which is uneccessary
  * maybe encrypt complete database
- encrypt casts
