# JumPi

## What is JumPi

JumPi is a small collection of tools to create a SSH jumphost. As the
name suggests, it was developed to be used on a Raspberry Pi. But it
should run on any Linux system.

### What happened to the old JumPi

The old jumpi had some flaws. One of them is, that it can't be used via
the "ProxyCommand" option. Thus it's not a real jumphost. This version
should fix this issue.
