# Configuration for the pyvault secure storage

[vault]
# Number of iterations to use when deriving master passphrase from the
# provided by the unlock operation. The key is derived by using PBKDF2.
#
# The number should be chosen so that the unlock operation takes about
# 1-2 seconds, so that Brute-Force Attempts are slowed down. The default
# is somewhat optimized for Raspberry Pi's.
#
# Once the vault has been created, any change to this value, will have
# no effect.

# Default: 500
iterations = <integer>

# Configuration for encryption

[cipher]

# Configuration for Yubico YubiKey OTP
# http://www.yubico.com
#
[yubico]
# Comma separated list of API endpoints for validating Yubico
# OTP tokens. Useful if you have setup your own validation server
# in your enterprise.

# Example: https://api.yubico.com/wsapi/2.0/verify
# Default: Yubico Cloud Validation Service URLs
api_url = <url>[,<url>,...]

# ClientID and secret key as given by the registration site for the use
# of the public cloud API servers. The default of empty clientid and
# no secret will not work and will always yield in faulting
# validation of your OTP.
#
# Note that you might not need this if you have your own validation
# server.
#
# You can register under the following URL:
#     https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/

api_secret = <string>

# Absolute path to a path holding valid CA bundles. Useful if you
# have your own validation server in your enterprise with a
# certificate not signed by any of the well-known CAs.
#
# Default: Standard Locations of most Operating Systems
