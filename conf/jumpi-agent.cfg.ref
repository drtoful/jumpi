[vault]

# provided by the unlock operation. The key is derived by using PBKDF2.

# The number should be chosen so that the unlock operation takes about
# 1-2 seconds, so that Brute-Force Attempts are slowed down. The default
# is somewhat optimized for Raspberry Pi's.
#
# Once the vault has been created, any change to this value, will have
# no effect.

# Default: 500
